# Workday-Hackathon

Created at the workda Hackathon in Trinity College Dublin on 27th November 2017

Spec:
"The theme? Music! 

This is quite a broad theme, and can range from 
anything from software interfacing with a 
music-based web API, to rhythm games, to MIDI
synthesising programs or any other cool 
music-related projects you can think of!"

Created by Prapti Setty, Patrick Jennings and Conor Clery
(Students of Trinity College Dublin - 2nd Year)
